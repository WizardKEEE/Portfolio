                <h2>Game Programmer</h1>
                <p>I have loved games since I was a little kid. As I got older I became interested in the process of making the games.</p>

                <h2>First Tech Challenge</h2>
                <p>I have a love for coding and I was convinced to join my schools robotics club. In my final year of robotics I was asked to be the lead coder for my team.</p>

                <h2>Hobo</h2>
                <p>This was a nickname that was given to me by a friend of mine when we were in our rti. We had two Andrews with us and they wouldn't know which one to address if both of us were in a match of SSBU. So one of the guys there had just refered to me as the homeless one. It became my name tag in SSBU and I still use it to this day.</p>
